    For the time being, documents are indexed using their hashes, and users

            - Full: Delete all documents that haven to been returned by the loader.
                    Clean up runs after all documents have been indexed.
                    This means that users may see duplicated content during indexing.

        source_id_key: Optional key that helps identify the original source

        cleanup_batch_size: Batch size to use when cleaning up documents.
        force_update: Force update documents even if they are present in the
