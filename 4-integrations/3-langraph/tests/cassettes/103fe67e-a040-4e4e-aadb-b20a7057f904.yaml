        facilitate the transition from LCEL (LangChain Expression Language) prototypes
        to production-ready applications.[5]\nIntegrations[edit]\nAs of March 2023,
        LangChain included integrations with systems including Amazon, Google, and
        Microsoft Azure cloud storage; API wrappers for news, movie information, and
        weather; Bash for summarization, syntax and semantics checking, and execution
        of shell scripts; multiple web scraping subsystems and templates; few-shot
        learning prompt generation support; finding and summarizing \"todo\" tasks
        in code; Google Drive documents, spreadsheets, and presentations summarization,
        extraction, and creation; Google Search and Microsoft Bing web search; OpenAI,
        Anthropic, and Hugging Face language models; iFixit repair guides and wikis

        use-cases largely overlap with those of language models in general, including
        document analysis and summarization, chatbots, and code analysis.[2]\nHistory[edit]\nLangChain
        was launched in October 2022 as an open source project by Harrison Chase,
        while working at machine learning startup Robust Intelligence. In April 2023,
        LangChain had incorporated and the new startup raised over $20 million in
        funding at a valuation of at least $200 million from venture firm Sequoia
        Capital, a week after announcing a $10 million seed investment from Benchmark.[3][4]\n
        The project quickly garnered popularity, with improvements from hundreds of
        contributors on GitHub, trending discussions on Twitter, lively activity on
        the project''s Discord server, many YouTube tutorials, and meetups in San
        Francisco and London. As of April 2023, it can read from more than 50 document
        types and data sources.[9]\nReferences[edit]\nExternal links[edit]","score":0.99694854,"raw_content":null},{"title":"Harrison

      \"content\": \"In October 2023 LangChain introduced LangServe, a deployment
      tool designed to facilitate the transition from LCEL (LangChain Expression Language)
      prototypes to production-ready applications.[5]\\nIntegrations[edit]\\nAs of
      March 2023, LangChain included integrations with systems including Amazon, Google,
      and Microsoft Azure cloud storage; API wrappers for news, movie information,
      and weather; Bash for summarization, syntax and semantics checking, and execution
      of shell scripts; multiple web scraping subsystems and templates; few-shot learning
      prompt generation support; finding and summarizing \\\"todo\\\" tasks in code;
      Google Drive documents, spreadsheets, and presentations summarization, extraction,
      and creation; Google Search and Microsoft Bing web search; OpenAI, Anthropic,
      and Hugging Face language models; iFixit repair guides and wikis search and
      summarization; MapReduce for question answering, combining documents, and question
      generation; N-gram overlap scoring; PyPDF, pdfminer, fitz, and pymupdf for PDF
      file text extraction and manipulation; Python and JavaScript code generation,
      analysis, and debugging; Milvus vector database[6] to store and retrieve vector
      embeddings; Weaviate vector database[7] to cache embedding and data objects;
      Redis cache database storage; Python RequestsWrapper and other methods for API
      requests; SQL and NoSQL databases including JSON support; Streamlit, including
      for logging; text mapping for k-nearest neighbors search; time zone conversion
      and calendar operations; tracing and recording stack symbols in threaded and
      asynchronous subprocess runs; and the Wolfram Alpha website and SDK.[8] As a
      language model integration framework, LangChain''s use-cases largely overlap
      with those of language models in general, including document analysis and summarization,
      chatbots, and code analysis.[2]\\nHistory[edit]\\nLangChain was launched in
      October 2022 as an open source project by Harrison Chase, while working at machine
      learning startup Robust Intelligence. In April 2023, LangChain had incorporated
      and the new startup raised over $20 million in funding at a valuation of at
      least $200 million from venture firm Sequoia Capital, a week after announcing
      a $10 million seed investment from Benchmark.[3][4]\\n The project quickly garnered
      popularity, with improvements from hundreds of contributors on GitHub, trending
      discussions on Twitter, lively activity on the project''s Discord server, many
      YouTube tutorials, and meetups in San Francisco and London. As of April 2023,
      it can read from more than 50 document types and data sources.[9]\\nReferences[edit]\\nExternal

      \"content\": \"In October 2023 LangChain introduced LangServe, a deployment
      tool designed to facilitate the transition from LCEL (LangChain Expression Language)
      prototypes to production-ready applications.[5]\\nIntegrations[edit]\\nAs of
      March 2023, LangChain included integrations with systems including Amazon, Google,
      and Microsoft Azure cloud storage; API wrappers for news, movie information,
      and weather; Bash for summarization, syntax and semantics checking, and execution
      of shell scripts; multiple web scraping subsystems and templates; few-shot learning
      prompt generation support; finding and summarizing \\\"todo\\\" tasks in code;
      Google Drive documents, spreadsheets, and presentations summarization, extraction,
      and creation; Google Search and Microsoft Bing web search; OpenAI, Anthropic,
      and Hugging Face language models; iFixit repair guides and wikis search and
      summarization; MapReduce for question answering, combining documents, and question
      generation; N-gram overlap scoring; PyPDF, pdfminer, fitz, and pymupdf for PDF
      file text extraction and manipulation; Python and JavaScript code generation,
      analysis, and debugging; Milvus vector database[6] to store and retrieve vector
      embeddings; Weaviate vector database[7] to cache embedding and data objects;
      Redis cache database storage; Python RequestsWrapper and other methods for API
      requests; SQL and NoSQL databases including JSON support; Streamlit, including
      for logging; text mapping for k-nearest neighbors search; time zone conversion
      and calendar operations; tracing and recording stack symbols in threaded and
      asynchronous subprocess runs; and the Wolfram Alpha website and SDK.[8] As a
      language model integration framework, LangChain''s use-cases largely overlap
      with those of language models in general, including document analysis and summarization,
      chatbots, and code analysis.[2]\\nHistory[edit]\\nLangChain was launched in
      October 2022 as an open source project by Harrison Chase, while working at machine
      learning startup Robust Intelligence. In April 2023, LangChain had incorporated
      and the new startup raised over $20 million in funding at a valuation of at
      least $200 million from venture firm Sequoia Capital, a week after announcing
      a $10 million seed investment from Benchmark.[3][4]\\n The project quickly garnered
      popularity, with improvements from hundreds of contributors on GitHub, trending
      discussions on Twitter, lively activity on the project''s Discord server, many
      YouTube tutorials, and meetups in San Francisco and London. As of April 2023,
      it can read from more than 50 document types and data sources.[9]\\nReferences[edit]\\nExternal
