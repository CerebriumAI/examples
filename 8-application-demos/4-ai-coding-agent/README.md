# AI Coding Agent

A modern AI-powered coding assistant that generates and deploys code to a secure sandbox in real-time through natural language conversations. Built with Cerebrium and E2B, this system provides an intuitive interface for turning your ideas into working code in no time.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Real-time Code Generation**: Watch as code is generated instantly as you describe your needs
- **Live Preview**: See your code running in a sandboxed environment
- **File Tree Navigation**: Browse generated files with ease

## ðŸ›  How It Works

1. **Describe Your Needs**: Start a conversation with the agent about what you want to build
2. **Watch Code Generation**: See code being written in real-time with syntax highlighting
3. **Preview Instantly**: Click the preview link to see your code running live

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui (Access the frontend code, [here](https://github.com/CerebriumAI/example-ai-coding-agent))
- **Backend**: FastAPI, WebSocket for real-time communication
- **LLM**: Qwen 2.5 7B models for code generation running on Cerebrium cloud infrastructure
- **Preview**: Sandboxed environment for secure code execution running on E2B

## ðŸš¦ Limitations

- LLMs are capable of hallucinating. As we're using a large language model with half-precision, it may generate code that doesn't work as expected. Please review the generated code before running it in a production environment.
