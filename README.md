Welcome to Cerebrium's official examples repository! This collection of examples helps you get started with building Machine Learning / AI applications on the platform. Whether you're looking to deploy LLMs, process voice data, or handle image and video tasks, you'll find practical, ready-to-use examples here.

## How to Use This Repository

Each example is a self-contained project that demonstrates a specific use case. You can explore the examples in any order, depending on your interests and needs. Each example includes detailed instructions on how to deploy the application on the Cerebrium platform.

Deploy each example by cloning the repo and running the `cerebrium deploy` command in each example folder.
